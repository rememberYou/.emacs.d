![Emacs Logo](assets/emacs.png "Emacs logo") Personal configuration of Emacs
===============================

This repository contains all of my Emacs configuration.

Main configuration files:

* [`init.el`](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el/) :
  allows to load the generated `config.org` configuration file.

* [`config.org`](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.org/) :
  Emacs configuration file editable by the user.

* [`config.el`](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.el/):
  file generated by Emacs according to `config.org` to increase the loading
  speed.

* [`config.bash`](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.bash/) :
  files containing packages installed in Bash with Arch Linux.

* [`custom.el`](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d/blob/master/custom.el/) :
  customization file generated by Emacs.

I wanted to make this configuration simple, powerful and ergonomic by choosing
the most trivial keybinding that it is.

--------------------

### Getting started ###

If you are new to Emacs, I advise you to take code blocks from
the
[`config.org`](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.org/)
file to your own configuration file, carefully with parentheses and evaluate them
with `eval-last-sepx` (`C-x C-e`).

For the most curious, you can test my complete configuration with:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d

Notes that the first time Emacs starts, this one will install some additional
packages that are best handled by the package manager.

--------------------

### TODO ###

Here is a list of tasks I plan to do in my spare time to improve this
configuration:

*  Read my RSS feeds with Emacs.
*  Update my configuration with new changes made by `use-package`.
*  Show images on `erc` in the center of the buffer with `magic-buffer`.
*  Show images on `erc` only if they are not large with `imagemagick`.
*  Set up notifications on `erc` when my name is quoted.
*  Write a function to know the number of entities on a channel with `erc`.

--------------------

### Contributions ###

Various functions may be optimized or spelling errors may occur. If you want to
make your own correction on this configuration, you are free to do so.

Please note that I can't guarantee that your changes will be accepted.

--------------------

### License ###

The code is unlicensed, take what you like and hope that this configuration file
can be so useful to you that it is for me.

Emacs is above all a concept of sharing in order to facilitate our daily life.
